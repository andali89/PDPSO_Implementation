# PDPSO Implementation

This is an implementation of a discrete particle swarm optimizaiton algorithm 
called PDPSO for product portfolio planning problems. The algorithm adopts a 
probability-based solution updating mechanism and a solution reparing strategy
to improve the performance. For a detailed description of the PDPSO algorihtm
please refer to
